# CRUD with Typescript


Creating a CRUD for student enrollment, using Typescript

Application originally developed by the Alura typescript couse, but refactored by me to fix content and apply methods learned in other courses. 

Application following the SPA concept, so it has creation of elements in the DOM with Javascript.

Course application repository without the refactoration [HERE](https://github.com/SamuelMenecucci/alura-typescript-course).
